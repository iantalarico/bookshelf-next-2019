# Bookshelf Code used in Cloud Next 2019 Talk: Super-charge your GKE Developer Workflow in Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ

This is a slightly modified version of the [Deploy Bookshelf to Google Kubernetes Engine](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-getting-started/tree/master/optional-kubernetes-engine) sample for NodeJS.

## About this Code

This code was for demo purposes only and may not be the best example of well written software:

- In many places a GCP project id is hard coded (bookshelf-next-2019)
- Error handling is lacking
- The OAuth flow is not set up
- Unused files and code is not cleaned up.
- And many other issues

## About the Talk/Demo
